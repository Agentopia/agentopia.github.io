          <h2>Our Pledge</h2>
          <p>
            In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to
            making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless
            of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of
            experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual
            identity and orientation.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Standards</h2>
          <p>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
            <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
            <li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
            <li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
            <li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Our Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>
            Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to
            take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
          </p>

          <h2>Enforcement</h2>
          <p>
            Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the
            project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed
            necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
