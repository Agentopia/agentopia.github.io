# AI Agent Category Standards

## Overview

This document defines the standards and requirements for each agent category in the AI Agentopia platform. These standards ensure consistency, quality, and clear differentiation between agent types.

## Core Classification Fields

The Agentopia platform uses a multi-faceted approach to classify agents, primarily through the following fields in the `agent.json` manifest:

### 1. `category` (Functional Domain)

*   **Definition**: Primary functional or domain-oriented category for the agent. This field helps users find agents relevant to their general area of interest.
*   **Type**: `string`
*   **Requirement**: Required
*   **Allowed Values** (as defined in `agent-manifest.schema.json`):
    *   `"Data Analysis & Research"`
    *   `"Productivity & Organization"`
    *   `"Automation & Utilities"`
    *   `"Creative Content & Design"`
*   **Example**: `"Data Analysis & Research"`

### 2. `subcategory` (Granular Function)

*   **Definition**: An optional field for a more granular functional classification within the main `category`.
*   **Type**: `string`
*   **Requirement**: Optional
*   **Example**: If `category` is `"Productivity & Organization"`, a `subcategory` could be `"Task Management"` or `"Note Taking"`.

### 3. `agentType` (Operational Mode)

*   **Definition**: Describes the agent's primary operational mode, indicating how it interacts with users and makes decisions.
*   **Type**: `string`
*   **Requirement**: Required
*   **Allowed Values** (as defined in `agent-manifest.schema.json`):
    *   `"Assistant"`: User-directed; typically requires explicit commands or prompts to perform tasks.
    *   `"Autonomous"`: Self-directed; capable of pursuing goals and making decisions independently once initiated.
    *   `"Hybrid"`: Mixed-initiative; combines aspects of both Assistant and Autonomous modes, potentially taking some actions autonomously while still allowing for user direction.
*   **Example**: `"Autonomous"`

### 4. `agentScale` (Structural Complexity)

*   **Definition**: Describes the structural complexity of the agent, particularly whether it operates alone or as part of a larger system.
*   **Type**: `string`
*   **Requirement**: Required
*   **Allowed Values** (as defined in `agent-manifest.schema.json`):
    *   `"Single-Agent"`: The agent operates as an individual, self-contained unit.
    *   `"Multi-Agent"`: The agent is designed to be part of a coordinated team or system of multiple agents working together.
*   **Example**: `"Single-Agent"`

## Quality Standards

### 1. Common Requirements

- Documentation
- Error handling
- Performance metrics
- Security measures
- Testing coverage

### 2. Category-Specific Standards

#### For `agentType: "Assistant"` (and relevant aspects of `"Hybrid"`)

- Response time to user commands/prompts
- Accuracy in interpreting and executing commands
- Quality of user interaction and feedback mechanisms
- Task completion rate based on user direction

#### For `agentType: "Autonomous"` (and relevant aspects of `"Hybrid"`)

- Quality and soundness of independent decisions
- Rate of successful goal achievement
- Efficiency in resource utilization during autonomous operation
- Adherence to safety protocols and operational constraints

#### For `agentScale: "Single-Agent"`

- Clarity of task focus and domain specificity
- Efficient use of resources as an individual unit
- Robustness and reliability of individual performance
- Clear metrics for individual capability assessment

#### For `agentScale: "Multi-Agent"`

- Efficiency of inter-agent coordination and communication
- Minimized communication overhead relative to task complexity
- Effectiveness of collective performance towards shared goals
- Scalability of the multi-agent system (e.g., adding more agents)
