# AI Agent Implementation Scaffolding Plan

## Overview
This document tracks the step-by-step progress of implementing a complete AI Agent in the Agentopia ecosystem, from initial scaffolding through to full deployment. It serves as both a checklist and a reference for future agent implementations.

## Current Progress

### 1. Portal Website Infrastructure âœ…
- [x] Agent gallery page with dynamic filtering
- [x] Agent detail page base structure
- [x] Dynamic data loading from JSON (`agents-data.json`)
- [x] Markdown rendering support (for descriptions, setup, notes, etc.)
- [x] Configuration form structure (UI elements generated from manifest)
- [x] Demo/source link integration (data path complete, hero button visibility issue pending)
- [x] Full agent detail rendering (long description, structured setup, use cases, requirements, roadmap, LLM dependency, privacy considerations, Docker info)
- [x] Loading state transitions
- [x] Error handling (e.g., agent not found)
- [x] Navigation between agents (Back to Agents link)

### 2. Agent Development Framework âœ…
- [x] Basic repository structure (`AIAgentopia`)
- [x] Agent manifest schema (extended to include comprehensive fields like `long_description`, `setup_instructions`, `llm_dependency`, `docker_info`, etc.)
- [x] Validation tools (`validate-agents.js` - may need review for new schema fields)
- [x] Documentation structure (initial guides in place)
- [x] Integration workflow (`sync-agents.js` synchronizes data to portal)
- [x] Sample agent template (Data Analyzer Bot serves as a comprehensive example)

### 3. First Agent Implementation (Data Analyzer Bot) ðŸš§
- [x] Select agent type and category (Defined in Data Analyzer Bot manifest)
- [x] Create agent manifest (`agent.json` for Data Analyzer Bot, fully populated with new fields)
- [x] Write setup instructions (Included in manifest and `README.md` for Data Analyzer Bot)
- [x] Define configuration options (Specified in manifest for Data Analyzer Bot)
- [x] Create source repository and agent directory structure (`AIAgentopia/agents/data-analyzer-bot/`)
- [x] Test integration with portal (All manifest data for Data Analyzer Bot now correctly displays on detail page)
- [ ] Implement core functionality (Python scripts, `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt` for Data Analyzer Bot)
- [ ] Add demo implementation (Functional demo for Data Analyzer Bot)
- [ ] Resolve hero button visibility for demo/source links on agent detail page

### 4. Documentation & Testing
- [ ] Update agent development guide
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Write API documentation
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Security review

### 5. Deployment & Release
- [ ] Final manifest validation
- [ ] Sync with portal website
- [ ] Verify all features work
- [ ] Create release notes
- [ ] Tag version
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Monitor initial usage

## Next Steps
1. **Select Agent Type**
   - Review available categories
   - Identify user needs
   - Choose appropriate scale
   - Define key features

2. **Implementation Plan**
   - Break down core functionality
   - List required dependencies
   - Plan testing strategy
   - Set development milestones

## Notes
- Portal infrastructure significantly enhanced to display all new agent manifest fields.
- Agent development framework in `AIAgentopia` supports extended manifest schema.
- Scaffolding for the first agent (Data Analyzer Bot) is complete in terms of manifest definition and portal display capability.
- Next major step for Data Analyzer Bot is implementation of its core Python logic and Dockerization.
- Outstanding portal UI issue: Hero section button visibility for demo/source links.
