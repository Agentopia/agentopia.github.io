# AI Agent Category Standards

## Overview
This document defines the standards and requirements for each agent category in the AI Agentopia platform. These standards ensure consistency, quality, and clear differentiation between agent types.

## Core Categories Matrix

### 1. Regular Single Agent
#### Definition
- Single autonomous unit with direct user interaction
- Operates under explicit user commands
- Focused on specific tasks or domains

#### Requirements
- Clear input/output interface
- Direct command handling
- Task-specific capabilities
- User feedback mechanisms

#### Examples
- Chat assistants
- Task-specific helpers
- Specialized tools

### 2. Regular Multi-Agent
#### Definition
- Multiple coordinated agents
- User-directed collaboration
- Shared task execution

#### Requirements
- Inter-agent communication protocol
- Role definition for each agent
- Coordination mechanisms
- Task distribution system

#### Examples
- Team-based assistants
- Workflow systems
- Distributed task handlers

### 3. Autonomous Single Agent
#### Definition
- Self-directed single agent
- Goal-oriented behavior
- Independent decision-making

#### Requirements
- Goal setting mechanism
- Self-monitoring capabilities
- Decision-making framework
- Safety constraints

#### Examples
- Research agents
- Data analysis agents
- Autonomous task executors

### 4. Autonomous Multi-Agent
#### Definition
- Self-organizing agent network
- Emergent behavior
- Collective decision-making

#### Requirements
- Swarm coordination
- Distributed decision-making
- Collective goal alignment
- Network safety protocols

#### Examples
- Market analysis systems
- Distributed problem solvers
