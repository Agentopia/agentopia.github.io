Ensure Docker is running on your machine.\n2.  Build the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile` or pull a pre-built image (see `docker_pull_instructions`).\n3.  Run the Docker container using the `docker_run_instructions`.\n4.  Access the Streamlit web interface by opening your browser to `http://localhost:8501`.\n\n### Option 2: Running Locally with Python\n1.  Clone the agent's source code repository (if applicable, or download the agent files).\n2.  Navigate to the agent's root directory: `cd agents/data-analyzer-bot`.\n3.  Create and activate a Python virtual environment:\n    *   `python -m venv .venv`\n    *   Windows: `.venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n    *   macOS/Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`\n4.
